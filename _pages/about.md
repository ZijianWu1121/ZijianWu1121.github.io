# About me

I am currently a student at [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Jie Song]("https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/SONG-Jie/jsongroas"). My research focuses on general grasping and manipulation skills of multi-fingered dexterous hands. Previously, I worked for four years at [TAPO](https://www.tapo.com/en/) and [DREAME](https://www.dreametech.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopjTLrnPBuzvDYJRBLCjDf-zoXCgxdxI4_0B7PR0jSNGym5bSyC) as an embedded software and robotics algorithm engineer, where I contributed to the development of [smart security cameras](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/cloud-camera/tapo-c320ws/) and [robotic vacuum cleaners](https://www.tp-link.com/us/smart-home/robot-vacuum/tapo-rv30c-plus/).

I have a strong interest in technology, especially robotics. I will devote myself to the research and development of robots to serve human.
