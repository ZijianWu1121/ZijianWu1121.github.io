I am a second-year Master's student at HKUST-GZ, with four years of prior work experience in the field of embedded software development for consumer electronics and robotics. My expertise includes operating system architecture, product design, hardware device drivers, and the development of navigation and SLAM algorithms for robots. 

I earned my Bachelor's degree from SCUT, where I actively participated in robotics competitions such as RoboMaster and RoboCon, securing consecutive championships in RoboMaster in 2017 and 2018.

My technical skill set encompasses a comprehensive understanding of embedded software systems, MCU development, Linux drivers, kernel and application programming, computer network protocol stack development, robotic navigation, SLAM algorithm development, and multi-view geometry algorithms.

Currently, my research focuses on the general grasping and manipulation skills of multi-fingered dexterous hands.
